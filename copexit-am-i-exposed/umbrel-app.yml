tagline: Bitcoin privacy scanner - see what the blockchain reveals about you
description: >-
  Paste a Bitcoin address or transaction ID and get a privacy score from 0 to 100
  with actionable findings. The engine runs 16 heuristics covering address reuse,
  change detection, CoinJoin detection, script type analysis, timing patterns,
  wallet fingerprinting, and more.


  All analysis runs client-side in your browser. API calls go directly to your
  local Umbrel mempool instance - no data leaves your network. No tracking,
  no logging, no third-party analytics.


  Requires the Mempool app to be installed.
releaseNotes: >-
  Privacy engine corrections from community feedback. Recommend Native SegWit
  (bc1q) instead of Taproot for single-sig upgrades - P2WPKH has the largest
  anonymity set. Fixed English text leaking in Spanish and other locales for
  partial-history and presend findings. Presend on Umbrel now escalates to
  HIGH risk when any transaction activity is detected with unavailable receive
  data. New FAQ entry covering 7 change detection sub-heuristics. Added
  Ashigaru to wallet recommendations. All changes translated across 5 locales.
