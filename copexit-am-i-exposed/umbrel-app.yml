tagline: Bitcoin privacy scanner - see what the blockchain reveals about you
description: >-
  Paste a Bitcoin address or transaction ID and get a privacy score from 0 to 100
  with actionable findings. The engine runs 16 heuristics covering address reuse,
  change detection, CoinJoin detection, script type analysis, timing patterns,
  wallet fingerprinting, and more.


  All analysis runs client-side in your browser. API calls go directly to your
  local Umbrel mempool instance - no data leaves your network. No tracking,
  no logging, no third-party analytics.


  Requires the Mempool app to be installed.
releaseNotes: >-
  Differentiated address scoring model. Address analysis now uses a higher
  base score (93 vs 70 for transactions), allowing perfect address hygiene
  to reach A+ (100/100). Address reuse penalties are now much harsher -
  first reuse instantly drops to F grade (-70 impact). Reuse impacts scale
  from -70 (2 transactions) to -93 (1000+ transactions). All reuse is now
  classified as critical severity.
