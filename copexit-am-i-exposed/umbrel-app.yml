description: >-
  Paste a Bitcoin address or transaction ID and get a privacy score from 0 to 100

  All analysis runs client-side in your browser. API calls go directly to your
  local Umbrel mempool instance - no data leaves your network. No tracking,
  no logging, no third-party analytics.


  Requires the Mempool app to be installed.
