tagline: Bitcoin privacy scanner - see what the blockchain reveals about you
description: >-
  Paste a Bitcoin address or transaction ID and get a privacy score from 0 to 100
  with actionable findings. The engine runs 16 heuristics covering address reuse,
  change detection, CoinJoin detection, script type analysis, timing patterns,
  wallet fingerprinting, and more.


  All analysis runs client-side in your browser. API calls go directly to your
  local Umbrel mempool instance - no data leaves your network. No tracking,
  no logging, no third-party analytics.


  Requires the Mempool app to be installed.
releaseNotes: >-
  Semantic chart gradients and visual overhaul across all 6 visualization
  components. Blue inputs, orange outputs, green CoinJoin mixer zones with
  directional link gradients. 3D sphere bubbles for UTXOs, per-segment
  gradient lines on privacy timeline. Pre-send destination check now
  escalates any address reuse to High Risk with clear "do not send"
  language. Grade B summary is now findings-aware - shows "Good privacy
  practices" when no negative findings exist.
