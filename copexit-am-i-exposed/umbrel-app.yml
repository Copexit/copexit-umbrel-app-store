tagline: Bitcoin privacy scanner - see what the blockchain reveals about you
description: >-
  Paste a Bitcoin address or transaction ID and get a privacy score from 0 to 100
  with actionable findings. The engine runs 16 heuristics covering address reuse,
  change detection, CoinJoin detection, script type analysis, timing patterns,
  wallet fingerprinting, and more.


  All analysis runs client-side in your browser. API calls go directly to your
  local Umbrel mempool instance - no data leaves your network. No tracking,
  no logging, no third-party analytics.


  Requires the Mempool app to be installed.
releaseNotes: >-
  Community feedback round. Wallet fingerprinting now correctly attributes
  Low-R signatures to Bitcoin Core / Sparrow (shared libsecp256k1 anonymity
  set). PayJoin recommendations updated to V2 wallets (Bull Bitcoin,
  Ashigaru). Peel Chain added to glossary. Examples now persist as a
  permanent tab alongside Recent and Bookmarks. Chainalysis check on Umbrel
  fixed - tor detection race condition resolved, CORS-safe error handling
  for sidecar failures. Developer mode (click logo 5x) adds a standalone
  tor proxy test panel.
