tagline: Bitcoin privacy scanner - see what the blockchain reveals about you
description: >-
  Paste a Bitcoin address or transaction ID and get a privacy score from 0 to 100
  with actionable findings. The engine runs 16 heuristics covering address reuse,
  change detection, CoinJoin detection, script type analysis, timing patterns,
  wallet fingerprinting, and more.


  All analysis runs client-side in your browser. API calls go directly to your
  local Umbrel mempool instance - no data leaves your network. No tracking,
  no logging, no third-party analytics.


  Requires the Mempool app to be installed.
releaseNotes: >-
  Fixed service worker caching bug that broke the app after every deploy.
  HTML now uses network-first strategy so updates load immediately.
  Setup guide now features Umbrel app install as the recommended option.
